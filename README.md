# hello-world
I'm Connor Reif. Right now I'm a second year GDD student at RIT.
I like to make little games in my free time. I've made Connect 4 in Python and Minesweeper in Windows Forms (C#)
Some games I like to play are Rocket League, Escape From Tarkov (EFT), Apex Legends, Valorant, Call of Duty, Minecraft and Terraria.
I also like to stay active, to do that I usually run, but I also dance and snowboard when I can.
